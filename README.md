# Jluk's Backups

JBackups is a program written in python that allows you to save the directories you need to back up and create it when you need it, as well as restore files.




# Usage
Just download and run the .exe file, lol.
Inside the program interface you will be able to set the directory where other directories will be copied to, add and remove them from the copy list, copy to the save directory and copy them from there to their own directories.

Note:The place where the program stores its config cannot be set from the interface, it may be inconvenient for some people, to change it, find the string
``` py
JJFile = Jfile("D:\\storage\BACKUPS\\JBACKUPS\\cfg")
```
And change the argument to the path you want. You can knock down the program with the new path or run it from the IDE, nobody cares.****
